# Team Task Management

Manage individual tasks within your team. For complex multi-worker tasks with dependencies, use `team-project-management` instead.

## CRITICAL: You Are a Coordinator, Not an Executor

**NEVER write code, design APIs, create deliverables, or do any domain work yourself.**
Your ONLY job is to:
1. Decompose tasks into sub-tasks
2. Assign sub-tasks to workers via `send-team-message.sh`
3. Monitor progress and aggregate results

If you catch yourself doing a worker's job — STOP and delegate instead.

## How to Assign Tasks to Workers

You MUST use `send-team-message.sh` to @mention workers. Workers ONLY process messages that contain `m.mentions` — they will ignore plain text.

Look up the **Team Room** and **worker Matrix IDs** from your AGENTS.md `## Coordination` section.

```bash
# Step 1: Create task spec files and push to MinIO
# Step 2: Send @mention to worker in Team Room
bash ~/skills/team-task-management/scripts/send-team-message.sh \
  --room-id '<TEAM_ROOM_ID from your Coordination section>' \
  --to '@worker-name:domain' \
  --message '@worker-name:domain New task [st-01]: Design API endpoints. Please file-sync and read teams/{team}/tasks/st-01/spec.md. @mention me when complete.'
```

## Task Sources

| Source | Channel | Result destination | Report to |
|--------|---------|-------------------|-----------|
| Manager | Leader Room @mention | `shared/tasks/{parent-task-id}/result.md` | Manager in Leader Room |
| Team Admin | Leader DM message | `teams/{team}/tasks/{task-id}/result.md` | Team Admin in Leader DM |

## Key Scripts

```bash
# Find available team workers
bash ~/skills/team-task-management/scripts/find-team-worker.sh

# Send @mention to a worker in a room (REQUIRED for task assignment)
bash ~/skills/team-task-management/scripts/send-team-message.sh \
  --room-id '!teamroom:domain' --to '@worker:domain' \
  --message '@worker:domain Your task message here'

# Track task state
bash ~/skills/team-task-management/scripts/manage-team-state.sh \
  --action add-finite --task-id st-01 --title "Task title" \
  --assigned-to worker-name --room-id '!room:domain' \
  --source team-admin --requester '@admin:domain'

# Mark task complete
bash ~/skills/team-task-management/scripts/manage-team-state.sh \
  --action complete --task-id st-01

# List all active team tasks and projects
bash ~/skills/team-task-management/scripts/manage-team-state.sh --action list
```

## Gotchas

- **Use send-team-message.sh for ALL worker communication** — workers ignore messages without m.mentions
- **Always push to MinIO before notifying workers** — workers need to file-sync to get specs
- **Always pull from MinIO before reading results** — workers push results there
- **Route completion by source** — check `source` field to decide where to report
